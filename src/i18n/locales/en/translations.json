    "design" : "I really appreciate designing the artistic part of a website in order to make it more attractive and effective for everyone. The design is mainly done with CSS but I also use different Frameworks such as Bootstrap v5 or Materialize. nowadays, it is difficult to do without these Frameworks because it saves time and simplifies the code. I would nevertheless be ready to completely code the desired design independently if such is your request.",

I think that a good team is above all made up of people who know how to play their role and respect those of their partners.

My initial studies in Business Management taught me that group spirit pushes to surpass expectations and objectives provided there is osmosis in the group. This is why each team must have a leader to give space to everyone and I could be this Leader in your company if the need arises.",
